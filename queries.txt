Why are FPGAs used? FPGAs can be reprogrammed to accomplish various tasks faster than a RISC module but slower than a dedicated ASIC circuit;FPGAs have permanent circuits drawn into the silicon to accomplish the required task, whereas ASICs work via connecting modules and thus its use cases are narrower;In comparison to ASICs, CPUs and FPGA modules can have a much lower execution time due to their optimised hardware configuration;FPGAs are significantly more energy efficient than ASICs for the same compute power.
